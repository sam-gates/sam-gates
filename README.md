### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I am Samuel Gates!

---

A full-stack web developer specializing in JavaScript, AWS, and many SaaS apps. Check out my toolbox below to see my skills and the tools I like to use! 

During my college days I always ended up being the one in the group project to do all the coding, and I knew that my career would revolve around that (though I wasn't quite sure what that would look like). Since graduating from The University of Tennessee with a degree in mechanical engineering I have been learning and working as both a web developer and all around problem solver. In my work I creatively solve problems both with AND without code. 

Right now I have a great interest in WebRTC, specifically with live video chat. 

When I'm not in front of the screen, you'll find me in front of a bigger screen watching a movie with my dog and fiancÃ© or playing video games. When weather permits I also love to do anything on a board, skateboarding, wakeboarding, snowboarding, and whatever else you can do on a board!

### How to code...

Now you may wonder how a mechanical engineer knows some of the ins and outs of web development. Well, if I am being totally honest, I still learn every day! I started coding in college where I had to take a few courses on MATLAB, and I ended up loving it and using it a lot to make my life easier in most of my other courses (except Thermodynamics and Heat Transfer, those two were tough). My experience with MATLAB was a great fundamental start for me and definitely made it easier to learn new languages. Fast-forward to getting a job as a web developer (with absolutely no experience) I turned to codecademy to help me out. 

codecademy's goal is to give anybody in the world the ability to learn modern technical skills and reach their full potential through code. They have courses and career path curriculum in all the languages and subjects you would ever need. If youâ€™re interested in learning how to code or develop new skills click my referral link below!
